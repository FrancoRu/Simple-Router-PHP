Change log for **Simple-Router-PHP**

## [1.0.0] - 2024-04-17

### Added
- **Initial Release:**
  * 4 initial methods, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
  * Ability to use function chaining for custom middleware usage.
  * Construction of global URLs for subsequent processing.

### Additional Notes
- **Initial Implementation for Routes Without Params Only:** The nature of the router itself will lead us to use params, but for now, this functionality will be left for future testing.
- **Testing:** Testing will be added periodically. Warning!!! Version *EXPERIMENTAL ONLY*.
