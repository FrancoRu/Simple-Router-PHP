# Simple-Router-PHP

This router offers a user-friendly and straightforward application, presenting itself as a lightweight and efficient option. Its inception stemmed from the need for a router within a highly constrained environment, where the decision to conserve resources prompted its development over other more resource-demanding alternatives. Unlike other options, which often come bundled with additional tools and features, many of which may not be necessary for the specific project at hand, this router focuses solely on providing essential routing functionality.
